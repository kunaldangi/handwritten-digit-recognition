# Possible Solutions

## 1. By Using a Machine Learning (Neural Network) Model

### What is Neural Network?

A neural network is a computational and mathematical model which is inspired by the human brain which has multiple neurons and synapses connected to each other in a order to process the information. The neural network would have multiple layers of neurons where each layer could have multiple neurons and these neurons are going to be connected to the neurons of the next layer. The first layer of the neural network is called the input layer and the last layer of the neural network is called the output layer. The layers in between are called hidden layers. So, the input layers takes the data as input and the output layer gives the output which is a final result that we are looking for.

Okay, so first layer which is input layer have multiple neurons and the number of neurons is depend upon the data we are going to provide to the model. These numbers of neurons is equal to the number of features we have in our data.

#### What is a Feature?

So, feature is a some kind of data of (characteristics, properties, attributes) which describes the data and already present in the data.
For example, if we have a data of fruits something like this:

| Color  | Sugar | Content | Acidity | Smell Score | Juice Type |
|--------|-------|---------|---------|-------------|------------|
| Yellow | 12.5  | 3.1     | 7       | 8           | Orange     |
| Red    | 15.0  | 2.5     | 6       | 9           | Apple      |

Here, we have the data of fruits and each fruit has some characteristics or you can say attributes like color, sugar, content, acidity, smell score and juice type. So, all of these are the features of the data which help us to predict or identify the fruit or a attribute of the fruit, or maybe a juice type of the fruit for unseen data.

### How it helps to predict the value of unseen data?

So, the neural network tries to learn or find the relationship between the features of multiple data which we are going to provide to the model.
So, the neural network will try to find the relationship between the features of the data by using the mathematical functions and for a good relationship to be found you have to provide a good amount of data to the model. So, the more data you provide to the model the more accurate the model will be.
